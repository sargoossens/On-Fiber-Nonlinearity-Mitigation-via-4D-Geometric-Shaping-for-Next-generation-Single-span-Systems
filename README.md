Published data for the "On Fiber Nonlinearity Mitigation via 4D Geometric Shaping for Next-generation Single-span Systems" paper.

Naming is done as follows: `<rate in Gbit>_<nr of bits per 4D-sym>_<symbol rate in GBd>_<achievable length in km>_<optimal launch power in dB>_<NGMI target>.mat/.txt`

Constellations are published both in MATLAB format (.mat) and in plain text format (.txt)
